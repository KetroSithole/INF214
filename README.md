## Introduction

This section provides a foundational understanding of database design and development, outlining key concepts and their significance in building efficient and scalable databases.

## Relational Model

Explore the relational model, a fundamental concept in database design. Understand how to structure data into tables and establish relationships between them to create a robust foundation for your database.

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

Learn the essentials of SQL, the standard language for interacting with relational databases. Covering basic to advanced queries, this section enables you to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data effectively.

## Entity Relationship Modeling

Dive into entity relationship modeling, a visual representation of data relationships. Understand how to create ER diagrams to depict the entities, attributes, and relationships within a database.

## Normalization

Explore normalization techniques to enhance database efficiency and eliminate data redundancy. Learn the normalization process to design databases that adhere to best practices.

## Database Development Life Cycle

Understand the life cycle of database development, from initial planning and design to implementation and maintenance. This section guides you through each phase, ensuring a systematic and successful database development process.

## Advanced Entity Relationship Modeling

Build upon your ER modeling skills with advanced techniques. Learn to handle complex relationships and create comprehensive ER diagrams that capture intricate data structures.

## Object-Oriented Databases

Explore the concept of object-oriented databases, a paradigm that extends traditional relational databases. Understand how to model data using objects and classes, providing a more flexible approach to database design.

## Advanced Practical Database Design

Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios with advanced practical database design. Explore case studies and hands-on examples that challenge your skills and deepen your understanding of complex database design challenges.
